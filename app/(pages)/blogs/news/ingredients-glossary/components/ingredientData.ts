When applied topically, it acts as an antioxidant, inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species, or ROS (a type of free radical that triggers skin damage). It also has an anti-inflammatory effect, which can help to decrease redness, and it prevents UV-induced DNA damage that can lead to dark spots. Most importantly, it disrupts your skin’s pigmentation process by acting on the MITF (Melanocyte Inducing Transcription Factor) gene to control melanin production, inhibit melanin transfer to the top layer of skin, and prevent UV light from triggering more melanin production.",

TetraHexyldecyl Ascorbate, a lab-created form of the vitamin, is oil-soluble, meaning it can penetrate the skin more effectively than water soluble versions. When formulated at the correct pH, as in our products, it is also highly stable. This form of vitamin C also acts as an antioxidant, essential cofactor in collagen synthesis, and exfoliator, promoting cell turnover. Plus, it can brighten skin tone by decreasing the activity of tyrosinase (a naturally occurring enzyme that regulates melanin production in the skin), which helps to inhibit irregular production of melanin.",
