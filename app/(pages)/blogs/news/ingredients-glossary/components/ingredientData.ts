      details:
         "This is a derivative of resorcinol, an ingredient that can be synthesized in a lab or created using extracts of plant resins (Dr. Idriss products use a lab-created version). 4-Butylresorcinol improves discoloration by inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase (a naturally occurring enzyme that regulates melanin production in the skin), thereby reducing the production of melanin.",

      details:
         "This lab-created molecule has a multi-pronged effect on discoloration. The proprietary version used in our products is called Brightenyl®, or Trihydroxybenzoic acid glucoside (THBG). When applied topically, it acts as an antioxidant, inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species, or ROS (a type of free radical that triggers skin damage). It also has an anti-inflammatory effect, which can help to decrease redness, and it prevents UV-induced DNA damage that can lead to dark spots. Most importantly, it disrupts your skin’s pigmentation process by acting on the MITF (Melanocyte Inducing Transcription Factor) gene to control melanin production, inhibit melanin transfer to the top layer of skin, and prevent UV light from triggering more melanin production.",

         "This hydrating ingredient can be derived naturally from the fats in certain plants or created in a lab (we use a lab-created version). It’s a humectant, meaning it attracts moisture from the air and locks it into the top layer of the skin, leaving it more hydrated. It’s also a component of skin’s Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMFs).",
