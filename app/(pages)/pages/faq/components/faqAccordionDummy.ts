Then we formulated with those same levels.

Then, we hired a third-party facility to prove efficacy. They ran a clinical study of 26 subjects who used The Depuffer for four weeks. The Depuffer was clinically proven to reduce skin redness and undereye puffiness. In addition to the industry-standard tests above, we sent The Depuffer to 100 nerds who follow @shereeneidriss and asked them to take before and after videos and provide feedback.",
